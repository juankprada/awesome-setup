My setup is still pending on the following

- Notification daemon and OSD (or alternatives) (Currently considering Dunst)
- Bluetooth widget/system tray icon
- Key bindings for multimedia and other actions
- Correctly handle multiple inputs
- Correctly configure picom for effects and speed.
- Correct Screen colors based on color temperature (Check out Redshift and Redshift-gtk)

-- To Consider
-- Should I rely on .xsessions instead of xmonad to start services?
-- Check stalonetray instead of Trayer (stalonetray is in fedora repos)
-- check https://starship.rs/ instad of ohmyzsh
